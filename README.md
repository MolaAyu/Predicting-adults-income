# Predicting-adults-income

Didactic purpose of the project:
* To encode categorical data for use with machine learning algorithms;
* To understand random forest learning algorithms for classification;
* To continue the investigations of overfitting.
* To learn to interpret a model by looking at feature importance scores.
Problem description 
We'll use the famous Adult dataset. This is a binary classification task, where our task is to predict whether an American individual earns more than $50,000 a year, given a number of numerical and categorical features. (The dataset was extracted from a 1994 census database.)
